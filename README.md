## Inspiration 💡

This project was inspired by the timeless tradition of writing letters to express love and gratitude. In a digital age, I wanted to recreate the magic of receiving a heartfelt letter with a modern, interactive twist.

## How It Works 🛠️

1. **Envelope Animation**: When the user clicks the "Open Letter" button, the envelope opens with a smooth animation, revealing the letter inside.
2. **Letter Content**: The letter contains a heartfelt message, which can be customized to suit your needs.
3. **Heart Page**: After reading the letter, the user can navigate to a "Heart" page by clicking the "Click Here" link.

## Features ✨

- **Interactive Envelope Animation**: Click to open the envelope and reveal the letter.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on all devices.
- **Customizable Content**: Easily edit the letter content to make it personal.
- **Routing**: Navigate to a "Heart" page after opening the letter.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation between pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and animations.
- **GitHub Pages**: For deployment.
